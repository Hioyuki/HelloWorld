# Overview

### Project Description
As a software engineer focused on networking and security, I have developed a **Client-Server Communication Tool** using Python's native socket library. This software establishes a persistent TCP connection between two endpoints, allowing for real-time, bidirectional message exchange.

The system consists of two main components:
* **Multithreaded-ready Server**: A backend that listens on a specific port, parses incoming string data, and returns dynamic responses based on predefined logic (e.g., time requests or greeting protocols).
* **Interactive Client**: A frontend terminal interface that captures user input and transmits it over the network to the server, displaying the processed response.

### Purpose of the Project
The primary goal of this project was to master the fundamentals of **Network Programming (Socket API)** and the **TCP/IP stack**. By building this from scratch, I aimed to:
* Understand the "Three-way Handshake" process programmatically.
* Implement data serialization and encoding/decoding (UTF-8) for network transit.
* Practice the "Small Steps" methodology in software development—starting with a simple connection and incrementally adding complexity like loops and conditional logic.

# Development Environment

### Tools & Infrastructure
* **Operating System**: macOS (Unix-based environment) / Kali Linux
* **Terminal Emulator**: Zsh/Bash for executing concurrent processes.
* **Version Control**: Git (optional but recommended)
* **Editor**: Visual Studio Code / Nano

### Programming Language
* **Python 3.x**: Utilized the standard `socket` library for low-level network interface access and `datetime` for dynamic content generation.
